As a trial user, you are given an opportunity to try out the wonderful features of Quizzy by selecting a particular study set to start with.

For paid and registered users, the study sets available are allocated based on the purchase and allocation. For trial users, only 1 study set is available for trying out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Study a learning set</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main set page organizes everything you want to learn and the different ways you can learn it. You can click on any of the study tools or play games or stay on this page for review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Print a learning set</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quizzy allows users to print their study sets for learning. Simply click locate the tools and click on the &ldquo;Print&rdquo; icon to open the printing options.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>B. Study Tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Flashcards</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start studying your terms and definitions in our main Flashcards mode. You can choose between two motions: Flip or Flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flip</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the Arrow buttons with your mouse to flip between cards and click the card to see the other side. You can also use the left and right arrow keys to advance cards and space bar to flip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By default, Quizlet shows you the term first, but if you&#39;d like to see both sides at once, click &quot;Both Sides&quot; in the sidebar on the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audio</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turn audio on and off in the sidebar, or click Advanced to slow down audio and turn it on or off for specific sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shuffle and Play</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use Shuffle to mix up your terms and Play for a hands-free mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try our Flow mode for another option of studying with Flashcards. You can advance with one motion - just use your down arrow key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Speller</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You type or write (depends on the language input functions that you are using) what you hear. This mode works best for mother tongue language vocabulary and pronunciation, spelling, and familiarizing yourself with terms you don&#39;t know very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With audio in various languages, Speller works automatically with almost any flashcard set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen to a term or definition and type in the correct response. Click on the &quot;replay audio&quot; button or click &quot;esc&quot; to repeat the term. In this case the answer is &ldquo;sake.&rdquo; If you type it in correctly you move on to the next question. If you make a mistake, Speller shows you which letters you missed so you can try again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must spell the word correctly to move on to the next term. Speller asks 7 terms per round, and in between rounds you see a Progress Checkpoint to see how you&rsquo;re doing. You must answer each term correctly twice in a row for it to count as &quot;Fully Learned.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speller is complete once you&rsquo;ve &quot;Fully Learned&quot; each term. On the results page you can see the percentage of answers correct in each round and which words you missed. You can repeat Speller again or move onto other Quizzy study modes or play games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Learn</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn Mode tests your knowledge of a subject after you&#39;ve studied it a few times. It keeps track of what you know and what you don&#39;t and retests you on your mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn prompts you with the back or the front of the flashcards you made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A correct answer is put in the &quot;Correct&quot; bucket. An incorrect answer is put in the &quot;Incorrect&quot; bucket. If you don&#39;t know the answer and select &quot;Give up,&quot; Learn makes you retype the answer correctly to proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quizlet tracks what you get right and wrong as you progress through a set. At the end of each round, Quizlet retests you on what you missed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer every term/definition correctly twice in a row and Learn mode ends, showing you which words you missed or answered correctly in each round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retest missed answers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After completing Learn mode you can choose to star the terms you missed and study just them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customize Learn Mode</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quizzy can prompt you with either side of the card. You can also turn on audio for Learn, by checking the &quot;Speak Text&quot; box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edit in Learn Mode</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you notice a mistake (or want to make a change) to your term or definition while in Learn Mode, it&#39;s easy to fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you answer the question (or give up), click &quot;Edit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then change whatever you&#39;d like in the term or definition and click &quot;Save.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Test</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can take customized practice tests on any study set or print it out and practice on paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1: Click the Test button on the main set page</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: Customize your Test</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quizzy will automatically generate a random test for you using the terms and definitions from your set of flashcards.

The top ten high scores are displayed on the &quot;Scores&quot; tab of the main set page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Dash</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the ultimate video game study simulation. Once you start the game, definitions will scroll across the screen. It&#39;s your job to type in the corresponding term to &quot;destroy&quot; the definition before it scrolls out of sight. The longer you play, the faster they scroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type the correct term as the definition appears on the screen. If you get it wrong at first, keep trying!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a definition makes it to the end of the screen without a correct answer, Space Race will make you type it in in order to move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can choose to have terms scroll across instead of the definitions, or to have a random mix of terms and definitions - just click the drop-down menu next to &quot;Show...&quot;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can change this at any time in the game; the next item to scroll across will reflect your changes. However, it may be helpful to pause the game first so that you don&#39;t accidentally miss a term. Just click &quot;Pause&quot; at the top of the screen. Keep going until you use all your &quot;lives.&quot; Then play again to beat the highest score!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to the &quot;Scores&quot; tab on the main set page to see the top ten high scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>D.

Facebook Login</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Login with Facebook allows external websites like Quizzy to use Facebook&#39;s login system. Instead of creating a Quizzy account by entering your email and password, everything is done automatically with one click.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can I link my Facebook account?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have registered for Quizzy with an email and password but have not linked your Facebook account, go to the Settings page and click &quot;Link your account to Facebook.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can I unlink my Facebook account?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can unlink your Facebook account at any time.

To ensure that other users can log in after you on a shared computer, make sure to go to facebook.com and log yourself out of your Facebook account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Troubleshooting</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you see a message that says &ldquo;Unable to load Facebook&rdquo; with a link to this page your computer didn&rsquo;t successfully load the Facebook login system. The likely reason for this was just a bad internet connection at the time. Please clear your browser&rsquo;s cache, refresh the Quizzy home page, and try again. If the problem persists after doing this, either Facebook&rsquo;s servers are having problems or your network is blocking access to Facebook. Contact your network administrator about this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.
